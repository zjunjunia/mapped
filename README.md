# Mathematics for forensics: modelling the transfer of contaminants from a finger to a surface
## Abstract
Understanding the transference of trace residue from a contaminant to a surface is important in many applications and in particular for forensic sciences where this allows for forensic reconstruction and provides evidence for criminal investigation. This project proposes a novel mathematical model for the behaviour of residue particles from a finger to a surface with increasing levels of complexity. This model is then verified by comparing with experimental data by using an optimisation algorithm and generating parameters for each variant of the model. 
## Contents
1. MaPPeD-1.3.py is the final model produced which includes the simple case, particle sizes and fragmentation.
2. filereading.py is the program used to import experimental data and run a least-square optimisation algorithm to produce parameters for each model.
